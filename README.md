This Python-based calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the Tkinter library.
The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a user-friendly interface. 
The application is designed with clear and responsive buttons, supporting both mouse and keyboard inputs. The project showcases essential skills in Python, including event handling,
GUI design, and software development best practices.
This project demonstrates my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing applications using Python.
